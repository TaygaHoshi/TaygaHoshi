# Welcome
I am TaygaHoshi, welcome to my profile.

## Current Projects
I am currently working on a SaaS project called [BTeamGen](https://bteamgen.tyghsh.cc/about) and an open source Tabletop Role Playing Game (TTRPG) called [Sigil of Uchma](https://github.com/TaygaHoshi/tt-project). 

## Past Projects
My notable past projects are [a pvp/wvw/raid team generator script for Guild Wars 2](https://github.com/TaygaHoshi/GW2TeamGenerator) and [a Japanese " i+1" sentence scraper](https://github.com/TaygaHoshi/japanese-i-plus-one-filter).

GW2TG is the predecessor for BTeamGen, and my inspiration for this project was the amount of manual labor that goes into a guild. Being a former guild master, I knew managing tournaments with players from different skill levels correctly was difficult. This script reduced the time and work by automating almost every step.

The sentence scraper was built for helping me collect "i+1" sentences to learn Japanese. This terminology comes from a language learning method called Mass Immersion Approach, which is an implementation of [Input Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_hypothesis).

I have various other smaller projects too, so have fun checking my GitHub profile.
