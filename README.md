### Welcome to my profile!
I am TaygaHoshi, a computer engineer student. I like open source software and data sets. [This is a link to my website](https://tyghsh.net).

#### Current Project
I am currently working on [Tagimag](https://github.com/TaygaHoshi/tagimag), an external metadata managing program. With this project, I aim to improve my Java and SQLite knowledge.

#### Past Projects
My important projects are [a pvp/wvw/raid team generator script for Guild Wars 2](https://github.com/TaygaHoshi/GW2TeamGenerator) and [a Japanese " i+1" sentence scraper](https://github.com/TaygaHoshi/japanese-i-plus-one-filter).

My inspiration for the GW2TG project was the amount of manual labor that goes into a guild. Being a former guild master, I knew managing tournaments with players from different skill levels correctly was difficult. This script reduced the time and work by automating almost every step.

The sentence scraper was built for helping me collect "i+1" sentences to learn Japanese. This terminology comes from a language learning method called Mass Immersion Approach, which is an implementation of [Input Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_hypothesis).

I have various other smaller projects too, so have fun checking my Github profile.
