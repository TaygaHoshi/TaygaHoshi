# Welcome
I am TaygaHoshi, welcome to my profile.

## Current Projects
I am currently working on two projects:
1. [Sigil of Uchma](https://sigil.tyghsh.cc) is an open source fantasy Tabletop RPG, based on mythologies of medieval Central Asian societies.
2. TadanoChess is a QT-based desktop database for chess analysis. It is currently closed source and heavily work in progress, but I plan to open source it as GPLv3.

## Past Projects
My notable past projects are, in no particular order:
1. [PvP/WvW/raid team generator script for Guild Wars 2](https://github.com/TaygaHoshi/GW2TeamGenerator),
2. [Japanese " i+1" sentence scraper](https://github.com/TaygaHoshi/japanese-i-plus-one-filter),
3. [Project templater bash script](https://github.com/TaygaHoshi/copierpaster), and
4. [A QT form generator that works with YAML](https://github.com/TaygaHoshi/yaml-to-gui)

GW2TG is a simple team generator program. My inspiration for this project was the amount of manual labor that goes into a guild. Being a former guild master, I knew managing tournaments with players from different skill levels correctly was difficult. This script reduced the time and work by automating almost every step.

The sentence scraper was built for helping me collect "i+1" sentences to learn Japanese. This terminology comes from a language learning method called Mass Immersion Approach, which is an implementation of [Input Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_hypothesis).

CopierPaster is a templater for project structures. It can be used for quickly bootstrapping a project's initial structure from custom templates.

yaml-to-gui is a converter that takes a YAML file and creates a corresponding GUI. It is written in C++.

I also have various smaller projects, so have fun checking my GitHub profile.
